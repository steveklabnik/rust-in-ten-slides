# Basic Syntax

A quick overview of basic Rust syntax

# Variables

`let` introduces new variables:

```rust
let x = 5;
```

Variables are immutable by default

```rust
let x = 5;
x += 1;
```

```text
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
  |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
  |     x += 1;
  |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

in order to modify them, you need to say
they're `mut`able:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x += 1;
```

# Basic Types

Rust is statically typed, but infers types for you. You can write them out if you'd like:

```rust
let x = 5;
let x: i32 = 5;
```

Rust has a few primitive types:

* **Booleans**: are *true* and *false*
* **Integers**: are both signed and unsigned. *u8*/*i8*, *u16*/*i16*, *u32*/*i32*, *u64*/*i64*, and *u128*/*i128*.
* **Floating point numbers**:, *f32* and *f64*
* **Tuples**: are for grouping different types together *(i32, f64, i8)*
* **Arrays**: that are fixed size *[u32; 3]* is the type of *[1, 2, 3]*
* **References**: like pointers but safer. *&i32* is the type of *&5*
* **Slices**: refer to parts of an array *&[u8]*
* **char**: is a single Unicode Scalar Value, and uses single quotes *'ðŸ¦€'*
* **&str**: is an immutable UTF-8 string *"this is a crab: ðŸ¦€"*

# Functions

Here's a small function that adds one to a number:

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

* `fn` declares a function, and the name `add_one` follows.
* `()`s show you the parameter list; you must write the names and types of your parameters; Rust won't infer these!
* The arrow `->` gives the return type. You can only return one thing, but don't forget, tuples work: `-> (i32, i32)`
* The body goes inside curly braces `{}`, and lines end with a semicolon `;`
* "everything is an expression"; so the last line is the return value, no `;`.

You can use `return` explicitly if you prefer, or to return early:

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    return x + 1;
}
```

# Printing to the Screen

The `println!` macro will let you print to the screen:

```rust
println!("Hello, world!");
```

You can do formatted print with `{}`:

```rust
println!("Here's a number: {} and another: {}", 42, 100);
```

You can debug print with `{:?}`:

```rust
println!("Display: {}", "hello"); // prints "Display: hello"
println!("Debug: {:?}", "hello"); // prints "Debug: "hello""
```

# Comments

Rust has two main kinds of comments.

Regular comments for your own use:

```rust
// Put whatever you'd like here, Rust doesn't care
```

And doc comments:

```rust
/// This comment documents the `foo` function.
///
/// You can use the `rustdoc` tool via `cargo doc` to generate
/// HTML documentation from these comments!
fn foo() {
    // ...
}
```

# `if` expressions

The `if` expression lets you do something if something is true or false,
and `else` is there too:

```rust
if something {
    println!("it was true!");
} else {
    println!("it was false");
}
```

Because `if` is an expression, you can use it in all kinds of places:

```rust
let power = if too_powerful { 0 } else { 100 };
```

Now `power` will be `0` or `100` based on the `too_powerful` variable's value.

# `for` and `while` Loops

`for` loops will let you iterate over a range or collection:

```rust
for i in 0..5 {
    println!("{}", i);
}

let list = [1, 5, 3, 17];

for i in &list {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

`while` loops loop until a condition is met:

```rust
let mut done = false;
let mut i = 0;

while !done {
    // do stuff with i
    if i > 5 { done = true; }
}
```

# Structs and enums

Structs let you group multiple primitive types together into one big type:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
};
```

Enums are similar, but you can only have one of the variants at a time:

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
    Green,
    Yellow,
    Red,
}

let light = TrafficLight::Green;
```

Enums are way more powerful than this, but that's for another set of slides!

# Methods

Methods are like functions, but take a special `self` parameter and can be called with method syntax:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("({}, {})", self.x, self.y);
    }
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

point.print(); // prints "(0, 0)"
